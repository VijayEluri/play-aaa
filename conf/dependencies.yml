# History
# 1.2c - authorized if privilege level equals to required one (previous must be larger than)
#      - enhancement apply to constructors
#      - Secure now includes "Check" implementation
#      - Fix bug: Privilege.findByName() query by unknown name: "name"
#      - Add new configuration item: aaa.buildAuthRegistry, when set to false
#        AAA will not build authorization registry on startup. User program could
#        call play.modules.aaa.Plugin.buildAuthRegistry() when priviledge and rights
#        configured
#      - Support _aaa.yml configuration file load on application start
#      - Dynamic access check now support model based on interface
# 1.2b - first workable version (on mongodb)
